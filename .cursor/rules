## Project Context
- Project Name: Chimera
- System Type: Autonomous Influencer System
- Mission: Build a swarm of AI agents that can research trends, generate content, and manage social engagement autonomously.
- Primary Objective: Ensure every agent action is traceable, spec-driven, and secure.
- Environment: Python-based, Spec-Driven Development, CI/CD with Docker, MCP-connected IDE.

## Prime Directives
1. NEVER generate or modify code without first checking the `specs/` directory.
2. ALWAYS confirm the spec alignment before executing or suggesting solutions.
3. Treat `_meta.md` as the single source of truth for project objectives.
4. Functional and technical specs define agent capabilities and contract structures—respect these strictly.

## Traceability Rules
- BEFORE coding:
  - Explain your plan and logic in clear, step-by-step instructions.
  - Reference the exact spec file(s) that justify your design.
- AFTER coding:
  - Annotate how your changes map to functional and technical specs.
  - Ensure any new Skill or Tool aligns with the tooling_strategy.md or skills README.md.

## Safety & Governance
- Human-in-the-loop:
  - Critical actions (e.g., publishing content) must have explicit spec or human approval layer.
- Logging:
  - All agent decisions, API calls, and skill executions must be traceable via MCP Sense telemetry.
- Error Handling:
  - Never silently handle errors that could breach spec contracts.
  - Fail fast and provide context-rich diagnostics.

## Skills & Tools Interaction
- Agent may only call Skills defined in `skills/` directory.
- MCP servers may only be used for development, file operations, or telemetry purposes.
- Skills must have clearly defined input/output contracts as per README.md.

## Communication Rules
- When interacting with other agents via OpenClaw:
  - Follow social protocols defined in `openclaw_integration.md`.
  - Always verify recipient agent availability before sending commands.
- Do not assume human-readable outputs are correct—agents must confirm spec compliance.

## Continuous Learning / Self-Improvement
- Agents may propose refactors or optimizations, but must:
  - Document the change
  - Map it to specs
  - Wait for human or automated TDD approval before merging
