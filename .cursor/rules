# ===================================================
# Project Chimera: IDE Agent Rules
# File: .cursor/rules
# Purpose: Define behavior and constraints for the IDE AI Agent
# ===================================================

# ------------------------
# Project Context
# ------------------------
- Project Name: Project Chimera
- Description: An autonomous influencer system that researches trends, generates content, and publishes it with minimal human intervention.
- Business Goal: Build a robust, scalable environment where AI agents execute tasks based on spec-driven development without hallucination or conflict.
- Human Oversight: Humans approve content at the "Safety Layer" only; all other steps are agent-controlled.

# ------------------------
# Prime Directive
# ------------------------
- NEVER generate code without first checking the specifications in the specs/ directory.
- Always reference:
  - specs/_meta.md
  - specs/functional.md
  - specs/technical.md
  - specs/openclaw_integration.md (if needed)
- Do not assume requirements — always follow the ratified specs.

# ------------------------
# Traceability & Reasoning
# ------------------------
- Always explain your plan in plain language **before** writing any code.
- Every action must be linked to a spec section.
- Maintain auditability — include reasoning and spec reference in commit messages.

# ------------------------
# Contextual Behavior
# ------------------------
- Treat Skills as the agent's runtime capabilities (skills/ directory).
- Treat MCP Servers as developer and infrastructure tools.
- Do not attempt to access tools not registered in the MCP servers.
- Confirm MCP server availability before executing dependent actions.

# ------------------------
# Allowed MCP Servers (Current Environment)
# ------------------------
- tenxfeedbackanalytics
  - Type: HTTP
  - URL: https://mcppulse.10academy.org/proxy
  - Tools Enabled: 3
  - Prompts Enabled: 1
  - Usage: Only for telemetry, logging, and analytics feedback.

# ------------------------
# Agent Skills (Runtime Capabilities)
# ------------------------
- skill_trend_fetcher: Fetch trending topics, validate against API contract.
- skill_content_generator: Generate social media content per trends with formatting rules.
- skill_publisher_content: Publish content to target channels, following human-in-the-loop approval if required.

# ------------------------
# Do's
# ------------------------
- Do read and interpret specs before writing any code.
- Do validate input/output against defined API contracts.
- Do log all actions to MCP for traceability.
- Do fail tests intentionally to define TDD "empty slots" for agent tasks.

# ------------------------
# Don'ts
# ------------------------
- Don't make assumptions about functional behavior.
- Don't bypass the human-in-the-loop safety layer.
- Don't attempt to access or use MCP servers or tools not installed in the current environment.
- Don't commit or generate code outside the approved Git workflow.

# ------------------------
# Communication Protocols
# ------------------------
- When referencing other agents (OpenClaw network), only publish:
  - Availability
  - Status updates
- Ensure all messages comply with the OpenClaw integration spec.

# ------------------------
# Summary
# ------------------------
- Your mission: Execute agent tasks **strictly according to the specifications**, using allowed MCP servers and skills, while logging all actions for traceability.
- Always plan, explain, and confirm before coding.
