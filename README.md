**Project Chimera: Autonomous AI Influencer Prototype**

---

## **Project Overview**

This repository contains the initial setup for **Project Chimera**, an initiative to build an **Autonomous AI Influencer** capable of researching trends, generating content, and interacting with digital networks autonomously.  

The focus of **Task 1 (The Strategist)** is to:  
- Understand the domain and market trends  
- Analyze architecture patterns for agent-based systems  
- Prepare a robust development environment for future AI agent orchestration

## **Development Environment**

* **Python Version:** 3.11
* **Dependency Manager:** `uv` (handles virtual environment & dependencies)
* **Core Libraries:** `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `plotly`
* **Development Tools:** `jupyter`, `pytest`, `mermaid`

**MCP Connection:**

* Connected to Tenx MCP Sense server (`tenxfeedbackanalytics`) for agent telemetry and IDE integration.
* GitHub Copilot Chat enabled for AI-assisted development.

---

## **Task 1 Deliverables**

1. `docs/architecture_strategy.md` → Detailed architecture document
2. `research/research_notes.md` → Research summary and social protocol analysis
3. `pyproject.toml` → Dependency management & environment setup
4. MCP telemetry verified in IDE

---

## **Next Steps**

* Populate `architecture_strategy.md` with chosen **agent pattern, HITL plan, and database design**
* Complete `research_notes.md` with insights from SRS and reference reading
* Prepare environment to support **Task 2 (The Architect)**
