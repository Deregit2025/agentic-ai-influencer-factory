# Project Chimera Architecture Strategy

## 1. Introduction
Project Chimera is an autonomous AI influencer system designed to research trends, generate content, and manage audience engagement without human intervention. The purpose of this document is to define the system architecture, agent patterns, database choices, and human-in-the-loop points to ensure scalability, reliability, and safety.

---

## 2. Agent Pattern
Project Chimera will use a **Hierarchical Swarm Pattern**:

- **Master Agent:** Coordinates the swarm and distributes tasks.  
- **Worker Agents:** Each agent specializes in one function (trend fetching, content generation, or publishing).  
- **Benefits:** Parallel task execution, fault tolerance, and faster content generation.  

This pattern allows multiple agents to operate independently while the master agent ensures alignment with the overall project goals.

## 3. Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)
A human reviewer will act as a safety layer in the content publishing workflow:

- **Content Approval:** Before any content is posted, a human will review it for accuracy, compliance, and quality.  
- **Safety Layer:** Prevents inappropriate content and ensures adherence to project guidelines.  
- **Interaction Point:** Between the Content Generator Agent and Publisher Agent.

## 4. Database Strategy
Project Chimera will store high-velocity video metadata generated by agents.  

- **Option 1: SQL (e.g., PostgreSQL)** – Good for structured data, ACID-compliant, strong consistency.  
- **Option 2: NoSQL (e.g., MongoDB)** – Handles large-scale, unstructured, high-velocity data efficiently.  
- **Chosen:** NoSQL (MongoDB)  
  - Rationale: Video metadata is semi-structured and generated at high speed. NoSQL allows scalable storage and faster read/write operations for multiple agents working in parallel.

* **Master Agent:** Oversees coordination, monitors performance, and ensures task distribution.
* **Worker Agents:** Specialized agents executing core functions.
* **MongoDB:** Central repository for storing video metadata, trends, and agent logs.
* **Human Reviewer:** Ensures content quality and safety before publication.

## 6. Summary

This architecture provides:

* **Scalability:** Parallel agent execution via swarm pattern.
* **Reliability:** Fault tolerance through hierarchical coordination.
* **Safety:** Human-in-the-loop content verification.
* **Performance:** NoSQL database for handling high-velocity metadata.
* **Future-Proofing:** Modular design allows adding new agent skills and tools without disrupting the system.
