# Project Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the planned evolution of **Project Chimera** beyond the initial architecture and setup phase.

---

## Phase 1: Architecture & Environment Setup (Completed)

- Define agent-based system architecture
- Design scalable repository structure
- Set up Docker-based development environment
- Configure Python dependency management
- Establish documentation standards

Status: ✅ Completed

---

## Phase 2: Core Agent & Skill Implementation (Planned)

- Implement base `Agent` abstraction
- Develop initial skill modules:
  - Trend fetching (APIs, scraping, datasets)
  - Content generation (LLM-based text/image generation)
  - Scheduling and publishing logic
- Add configuration-driven agent orchestration

Status: ⏳ Planned

---

## Phase 3: Human-in-the-Loop Controls (Planned)

- Manual approval checkpoints for generated content
- Editable content review interfaces (CLI or lightweight UI)
- Safety and moderation layers

Status: ⏳ Planned

---

## Phase 4: Testing & Validation (Planned)

- Unit tests for individual skills
- Integration tests for agent workflows
- Mocked external API testing
- Performance and failure-mode testing

Status: ⏳ Planned

---

## Phase 5: Platform Integration (Optional / Future)

- Social media platform APIs (e.g., Twitter/X, Instagram, YouTube)
- Analytics and feedback loops
- Content performance tracking
- Adaptive agent behavior based on engagement metrics

Status: 🔮 Future Consideration

---

## Phase 6: Production Hardening (Optional)

- CI/CD pipeline setup
- Secrets management
- Observability and logging
- Deployment strategies

Status: 🔮 Future Consideration

---

## Scope Note

This roadmap intentionally extends beyond the current task requirements.  
Only **Phase 1** was required and completed for this submission.

The remaining phases illustrate how the project can evolve into a full production-grade agentic AI system.
